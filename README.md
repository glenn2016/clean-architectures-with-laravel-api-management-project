# Project Management App

## 📝 Project Description
This project is a **project management application** designed to create and track projects with fine-grained user and task management.

The application is built around a **role-based system** with two types of users:

- **Team Leader**:
  - Can create new projects.
  - Can automatically add members to a team.
  - Can assign tasks to team members within a project.

- **Member**:
  - Receives tasks assigned by the team leader.
  - Participates in the progress of the projects they are assigned to.

The goal is to provide a solid foundation for a collaborative project tracking tool, with a clear hierarchy and role-based responsibilities.
